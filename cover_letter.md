## Cover Letter
My name is Liyuan Hsu. Since childhood, I’ve been extremely interested in vehicles, robots, and dreaming to build a sophisticated robotic system someday. With this background, robotics, optimal control, numerical optimization and computer programming are my favorite research topics. I’ve been working in related academic and industrial organizations for years.

Currently, I am doing a robotics task and motion planning project at Robert Bosch, Artificial Intelligence Center. We propose a novel learning-based graph search method to improve the synergies between high-level task planning and low-level motion planning (TAMP). The low-level learning from demonstrations (LfD) model is solely trained in Gazebo simulation environment using trajectories generated from existing Moveit motion planners. Combining with the proposed TAMP search method, this task-parameterized LfD model solves high-level assembly tasks both in the simulation environment and in real-world 7-DoF Frank Emika Panda robot. The research result is submitted to the 4th Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2020).

I did my master thesis at ETH Zurich with the topic, Transfer Learning for Mapless Quadrotor Navigation Using Recurrent Neural Network. Which was co-supervised by Prof. Moritz Diehl at Freiburg University and Prof. Otmar Hilliges at ETH Zurich. We use deep reinforcement learning model for short scale obstacle avoidance, and use LSTM neural networks to learn a long scale navigation model from the existing motion planner. This model was solely trained in OpenAI Gym simulation environment which capable of transferring seamlessly to the real-world without any fine-tuning. We successfully tested this model on PARROT BEBOP quadrotor with LIDAR range finder connecting under ROS framework. More information can be found on my Github: https://github.com/LiyuanHsu/Master-Thesis.

Before studying for my master’s degree, I spent two years at Ford Motor Company as an
automation engineer. My major task was programming and teaching multiple ABB IRB 6640 welding robots to improve manufacturing efficiency and increase productivity. My team made a great effort to reduce 15% cycle time in C346/C520 (Focus/ Kuga) vehicle production line. We also earned the “FORD ASIA PACIFIC RECOGNITION” Award.

From 2.5m huge welding robot in the vehicle production line to a small quadrotor and service robot arm in the laboratory, I believe my solid industrial and academic background would be a valuable foundation for my future career. Thank you very much for considering my application and looking forward to your positive response.
